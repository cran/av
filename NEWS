0.3
  - Input can now contain video, i.e. multiple images per file. Previously
    we would only read a single image from each input file, but now we read
    all of them.
  - Major refactoring to suppor the above, hopefully no breakage.
  - New functions av_video_convert() and av_audio_convert()
  - New function av_video_images()
  - Switch to R_UnwindProtect to implement cleanup on exit
  - Test, tests, tests, so many tests.

0.2
  - Initial CRAN release
